		<p id=nameColor>I am super excited to be part of this Software Engineering course! I have always been interested in exactly how websites are designed and structured, and learning how things work behind the scenes is something that I'm really into as well. I generally enjoy finding out exactly how things work, from start to finish, which is why I can't wait to learn how to do these sort of things on my own from this course! I really look forward to working with everybody, and expanding my knowledge of coding for the foreseeable future.</p>

     	<p>From this course, I hope to gain all the knowledge available to me that will hopefully set me up to be able to design and operate my own websites and applications in the future. I have always wanted to see others use something that I personally created, and by the end of this course I hope that is something I will be able to accomplish. Things like specifically designed software, and applications with unique functions for a society, or even for certain individuals, are all within my future scope of achievement, and I cannot wait to be able to get all of them done!</p>
